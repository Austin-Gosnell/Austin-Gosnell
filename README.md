# Hello, I'm Austin Gosnell.
This is my second semester and I am studying for a degree in cybersecurity.
#Projects:
1. I recently moved, so I am taking the chance to revamp my home PC setup.
2. I am trying to get back into photography. I did headshot and profile photography, but fell out of love due to client issues.
